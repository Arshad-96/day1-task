Introduction: 
	HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
 Over the years, it has evolved to keep up with the demands of modern web applications and user expectations.
 Two significant versions of HTTP are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, each with its own set of features and improvements.
 We will delve into the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 to better understand how they impact web performance and user experience.


HTTP/1.1
----------
@ Introduced in 1999
@ Uses a single, persistent connection for each resource
@ Limited parallelism, leading to head-of-line blocking
@ Compression is optional
@ No prioritization of resources



HTTP/2
----------
@ Introduced in 2015
@ Multiplexing: Allows multiple requests and responses simultaneously
@ Binary framing: Efficiently compresses headers
@ Header compression: Reduces overhead
@ Server push: Allows the server to send resources proactively
@ Prioritization: Resources can be assigned different priority levels

Performance Comparison:

* HTTP/2 significantly reduces latency due to multiplexing.

* Header compression minimizes overhead, improving load times.

* Server push enhances performance by sending resources proactively.

* Prioritization ensures critical resources are loaded faster.

Adoption and Considerations:

* HTTP/2 adoption is widespread, but HTTP/1.1 still prevalent.

* Ensure server and client support for HTTP/2.

* Consider upgrading to HTTP/2 for improved performance.

* Monitor performance metrics to validate improvements.

Conclusion:

* HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are significant HTTP versions.

* HTTP/2 offers superior performance through multiplexing, compression, and prioritization.

* The adoption of HTTP/2 can improve web user experiences.

* Stay informed about emerging HTTP standards for future enhancements.
